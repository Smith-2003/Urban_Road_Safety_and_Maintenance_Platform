# Casablanca Pothole Detection Project

Detect and map potholes in Casablanca using the YOLOv5 computer vision model. Trained on a dataset from Roboflow's Aegis Pothole Detection and rigorously tested with real-world images from the "Save Casablanca" Facebook group, this project aims to deploy the model on a drone for efficient and proactive road maintenance.

## Features

- **Pothole Detection:** Utilize the YOLOv5 model to accurately detect potholes in images.
- **Dataset:** Trained on a comprehensive dataset from Roboflow, ensuring robust model performance.
- **Real-world Testing:** Rigorously tested with images from the "Save Casablanca" Facebook group to validate performance in diverse conditions.
- **Drone Deployment:** Explore the potential of deploying the model on a drone for efficient road maintenance.

## Usage
